1 in 10 adults in Ohio—roughly 1 million people—has taken out a payday loan.3
No payday or auto title lenders are licensed under the Short-Term Loan Act, which passed the Ohio Legislature with bipartisan support in 2008 and was an attempt to curb payday loan rates. The industry then tried to get Ohio voters to repeal the legislative action. When that effort failed, lenders circumvented the law by obtaining licenses to operate as credit service organizations, which are not subject to fee limits.4
Ohio’s market consists of more than 650 payday loan storefronts in 76 counties, more than 90 percent of which are owned and operated by companies that also do business in other states.5
Payday loans in Ohio have unnecessarily high prices: Borrowers are charged up to four times what their peers pay in other states.
